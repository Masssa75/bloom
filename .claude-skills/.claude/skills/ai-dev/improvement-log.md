## December 19, 2025 - Initial Baseline (Session 5)

**Scenario:** Urgent Crisis (Teacher with escalating student)
**Overall Score:** 8/10

**What Worked:**
- Used all 5 components correctly (`<urgent>`, `<script>`, `<later>`, `<insight>`, `<note>`)
- Trauma-informed approach (nervous system, safety-first)
- Case-aware (mentioned Alex's fight response to transitions)
- Immediate actions were clear and prioritized

**Identified Improvements:**
1. Could cite specific documents ("See Quick Reference for more...")
2. Missing "Don't Do" list for crisis moments
3. No time expectations for de-escalation
4. Could benefit from Action Panel sidebar (future feature)

**Changes Made:** None yet - establishing baseline
