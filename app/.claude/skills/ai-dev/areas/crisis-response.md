## Baseline (Session 5 - December 19, 2025)

**Scenario:** Urgent Crisis (teacher with escalating student blocking door)

**Score:** 8/10

**What worked:**
- ✅ Used `<urgent>` with 3 clear immediate actions
- ✅ Used `<script>` with exact calming words
- ✅ Used `<later>` for follow-up steps
- ✅ Used `<insight>` connecting to trauma history
- ✅ Used `<note>` for context
- ✅ Trauma-informed language (regulation, safety-first)
- ✅ Case-aware (mentioned Alex's fight response to transitions)

**What needs improvement:**
- ❌ No document citations ("See Quick Reference...")
- ❌ No "don't do" list
- ❌ No time expectations for phases
- ❌ Could be more specific about escape routes

**Identified changes:**
1. Add instruction to cite relevant documents
2. Add "don't do" section to crisis responses
3. Add approximate timing guidance
