# Interview Mode - Development History

Tracking all iterations on AI discovery interview quality.

---

## Current Score: Not tested

**Status:** Manual testing only (no automated scenario yet)

---

## Baseline

*Not yet established.*

**Note:** Discovery interviews are harder to automate because they're multi-turn conversations. For now, test manually by:
1. Creating a new child with no documents
2. Opening chat (triggers interview mode)
3. Responding as a parent being interviewed
4. Evaluating AI's interview technique

**Expected focus areas:**
- Warm, open-ended questions
- Following the parent's lead
- Exploring: temperament, emotions, relationships, interests, strengths, edges
- Not interpreting during interview
- Knowing when to suggest wrapping up
- Generating useful summary and traits when closing
