# Scenario: Pattern Analysis Questions

## Persona
**Role:** Teacher or case coordinator
**Context:** Reviewing Alex's behavior over time
**Emotional state:** Analytical, seeking to understand

## Setup
- Use test child: Alex
- Start fresh chat session

## Scenario Message

```
I've noticed that Alex seems to have more difficult days on Mondays and after long weekends. Is there anything in his case file that might explain this pattern? And what strategies might help with these transition-back-to-school moments?
```

## Expected Response Qualities

### Must Have
- [ ] Reference to Alex's case file content
- [ ] Connection between pattern and documented history
- [ ] Explanation rooted in trauma/attachment framework
- [ ] Specific strategies for the identified pattern

### Should Have
- [ ] `<insight>` component with the "why"
- [ ] Reference to specific documents consulted
- [ ] Acknowledgment of good observation by the asker
- [ ] `<later>` with preventive strategies

### Should NOT Have
- [ ] `<urgent>` component (not a crisis)
- [ ] Speculation without case file basis
- [ ] Generic Monday/transition advice

## Evaluation Focus
1. **Document consultation** - Did it fetch relevant docs?
2. **Pattern explanation** - Connects observation to case history
3. **Framework application** - Uses trauma-informed lens
4. **Actionable recommendations** - Specific to the pattern

## Sample High-Quality Response Elements

**Good analysis:**
Looking at Alex's case file, this pattern makes sense. Alex experienced significant disruption in his early home environment, which can make transitions between settings (home ↔ school) particularly activating. Weekends mean two days of home routine, and returning to school requires a significant shift in his nervous system state.

**Good strategies:**
- Sunday evening preview of the week
- Monday morning check-in ritual
- Reduced demands on Mondays
- Connection before correction on transition days

## Notes
This scenario tests the AI's ability to synthesize case file information and provide analytical insights. It should demonstrate that it has actually read and understood Alex's documents.
